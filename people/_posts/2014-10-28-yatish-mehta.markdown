I am Master's Student at NCSU in the department of Computer Science. I am a passionate Rubyist and FOSS supporter. I am a lazy guy so I write shell scripts to automate stuff. I have some contributions on github [@yatish27](http://github.com/yatish27). I work mainly on Ruby on Rails. I love to discuss product incubation and startup ideas. I am enthusiast of Data Science and enjoy working on data mining projects. Feel Free to catch me on twitter [@yatish27](http://github.com/yatish27) or IRC. I blog at [yatishmehta.com](http://www.yatishmehta.com)
